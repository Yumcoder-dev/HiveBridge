# HiveBridge

## Democratizing Collaborative AI in Healthcare

HiveBridge is an open-source platform designed to facilitate the development and deployment of AI models in healthcare settings. By leveraging federated learning, HiveBridge enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train models without sharing sensitive data, ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.

## 🚀 Features

* **Federated Learning Infrastructure**: Train AI models across decentralized data sources without transferring raw data.
* **Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms**: Incorporates differential privacy and secure aggregation techniques.
* **Low-Code Workflow Builder**: Simplify the creation of machine learning pipelines with a user-friendly interface.
* **Scalable Architecture**: Built with modern technologies to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## 🧰 Developer Stack & Tooling

HiveBridge is built with modern, developer-friendly tools to support efficient, scalable, and maintainable development:

* **Parse Server Integration**
  Backend-as-a-service for managing authentication, roles, and real-time data.

* **TypeScript**
  Strongly typed codebase with support for both frontend and backend development.

* **Jest**
  Testing framework for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

* **ESLint & Prettier**
  Code linting and formatting for consistent and clean code style.

* **Nodemon**
  Automatic server restarts during development for rapid iteration.

* **Comprehensive Documentation**
  Clear project documentation including architecture, usage, and contribution guidelines.

* **Node.js Version Management with `nvm`**
  `.nvmrc` ensures consistent Node.js versions across development environments.
